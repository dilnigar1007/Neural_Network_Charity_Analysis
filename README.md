# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

### Purpose & Overview:
Purpose of this project is to test whether applicants for funding is successful or not for the foundation Alphabet Soup. We have collected our data "charity.csv" and used our knowledge of machine learning and deep learning/neural networks to achieve this.

### Results:
We started off removing any irrelavant objects/columns such as "EIN" and "NAME", and ran the code to get unique values for each columns. For columns that have more than 10 unique values, determined the number of data points for each unique value. Our target variable was "IS SUCCESSFUL" and we splitted to two 1 and 0, 1 for yes and 0 for no. 5,721 parameter was created with a three-layers training model. We also tried with one more layer in the second analysis where we had 18,751 parameteres, a lot more than the first one.
